#To do this problem we need to look at the probabilities of test results. 
#If you have the disease there is a 99% chance the test will be positive and a 1% chance it will be negtive.
#From this we can say that the probability of getting a negative result when having the disease is 1%.
#Now the chances of having the disease and gettign a postive result is 99% so the probability of this occuring is .01*.99 equals .99%.
#This result is much higher than in 5.1.
