#In this problem we want to find the probability of receiving a postive and negative test result when the disease is present.
#To do this we need to find the probability of receiving a negative result while the disease is present. We already know the postive case is .019.
#We start by setting up the equation, .001(1-.99)/((1-.99)*.001 + .95*.99).
#Once this number is computed, it is about 1.06 x 10^-5. Now we need to multiply this by .019 to obtain the final result.
#This equals 2.02 x 10^-7.
